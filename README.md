This is a statistic/applied math project for an upper division math class taught at UCLA.

It applies methods of risk parity to stacked regression in order to lower the prediction error of a dataset. The programming language is R and the dataset used is [Boston Housing](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mlbench/versions/2.1-1/topics/BostonHousing).
